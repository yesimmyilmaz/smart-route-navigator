# Smart Route Navigator: Muğla District Path Finder 

An interactive web-based map application designed to find the shortest path between districts in Muğla, Turkey. This project implements graph search algorithms to solve routing problems on a real-world map interface.

##  Features
* **Interactive Map:** Select start and destination points using district markers. 
* **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Baseline implementation for finding the optimal shortest path.
* **A* (A-Star) Search:** Advanced search algorithm using heuristics for better performance. 
* **Dynamic Graph Editing:** Users can add new locations by clicking on the map; new points are automatically connected to the nearest existing nodes.
* **Real-time Statistics:** Displays route steps, total distance (km), estimated travel time, and visited node counts for performance comparison. 

## Tools & Libraries
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript. 
* **Map Library:** Leaflet.js. 
* **Data Format:** External JSON (`graph-data.json`) for node and edge definitions.

# Smart Route Navigator: Muğla District Path Finder 

An interactive web-based map application designed to find the shortest path between districts in Muğla, Turkey. This project implements graph search algorithms to solve routing problems on a real-world map interface.

##  Features
* [cite_start]**Interactive Map:** Select start and destination points using district markers. [cite: 11]
* [cite_start]**Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Baseline implementation for finding the optimal shortest path. [cite: 13]
* [cite_start]**A* (A-Star) Search:** Advanced search algorithm using heuristics for better performance. [cite: 83]
* **Dynamic Graph Editing:** Users can add new locations by clicking on the map; new points are automatically connected to the nearest existing nodes. [cite: 85]
* [cite_start]**Real-time Statistics:** Displays route steps, total distance (km), estimated travel time, and visited node counts for performance comparison. [cite: 15, 34]

## Tools & Libraries
* [cite_start]**Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript. [cite: 18]
* **Map Library:** Leaflet.js. [cite: 19]
* [cite_start]**Data Format:** External JSON (`graph-data.json`) for node and edge definitions. [cite: 25, 45]
